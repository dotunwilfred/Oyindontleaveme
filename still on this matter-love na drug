She came online posted on her status about hepatitis, and celebrated two of her male friends.... yet she has left my messages unreplied 
Hey world, is it enough for me to be sad? angry? confused? turn a psycopath? or i should just love? 
does love hurt as such? always always?
no!
i cried, yes i did
or I am just fucking obsessed ... time will tell
I have got to pick my self up.
My Inner child will fight for me!
God is my source ...my everlasting source...
I just must cry on my wedding day.. AH ah!
