# Oyindontleaveme
Letter to my crush not to leave me 
it is hard to wrap my head around these things, Is it burn out? is it infatuations ? what is love?
if you are not here with me.. excuse you? if you cant even reply my text or match my vibe
Am i the romeo? do i have to do this to my self 
in the hasty hurrying grisp of love, i swindled and puddled myself.. alas i'm robbed of my sanity, my peace of mind
the more i let go the closer it stick... 
what do i do when heart broken? i just fucking turn to an unlearned poet
scribbling scrabbling, and sadly blabbering
love na drug!!!
I don talk am before
